# Wallet Connect Starter Kit

This Starter Kits shows how you can connect a browser with some of the main wallets available in cardano by implementing a simple React application.

It implements some of the methods defined in the [CIP-30 Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip30/) for showing the wallet state and information in the web browser.

This kit should be easy to extend for supporting new Wallets and implement the missing methods defined in the CIP-30.

## Build and Run the application

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
